## üî® Step 1: Prepare Android Build Configuration

### Update `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 34
    buildToolsVersion "34.0.0"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.ballup.app"  // Change this to your unique ID
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 34
        versionCode 1        // Increment for each release
        versionName "1.0.0"  // Your app version
        multiDexEnabled true
    }

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

### Update `android/gradle.properties`:
```properties
# Add these lines
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=ballup-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=ballup-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your-keystore-password
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your-key-password

# Performance optimizations
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

---

## üîê Step 2: Generate Signing Key

```bash
cd android/app

# Generate release keystore (KEEP THIS SECURE!)
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore ballup-release-key.keystore -alias ballup-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Answer the prompts:
# - First and last name: Your name
# - Organizational unit: Your company/team
# - Organization: Your organization
# - City: Your city
# - State: Your state
# - Country code: US (or your country)
# - Password: Choose a strong password (REMEMBER THIS!)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: 
- Store the keystore file and passwords securely
- Never commit keystore to version control
- Back up your keystore - losing it means you can't update your app!

---

## üì¶ Step 3: Build Release APK/AAB

### Clean and build:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean

# Generate APK (for testing)
./gradlew assembleRelease

./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Your files will be in:
- APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
